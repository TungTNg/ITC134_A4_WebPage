    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>As the quote above reveals - the development of AI and its application to Robotics is a very complicated topic. AI encompasses a huge array of issues, trends, and concerns on a wide variety of technical, software, moral and emotional levels. Our team has opted to address AI with a selective set of assessments inspired by the question: “Is this (AI Robotics) the smart thing to do?” - a question and treatment we believe to be highly relevant for our ITC 134 Class. Our approach was to first review the Robotic aspects of Artificial Intelligence which poses some of the largest potential impacts on our society and civilization. Then the white paper discusses the many different jobs that will be affected by AI Robotics commencing in the very near future. We continue to address the long term vision for AI as dependent on how the software can enable more “human-like” logic and self-learning processes. We present a “deep dive” on TensorFlow - a new library framework for machine learning, developed by the Google Brain team. This new and more powerful computing format is then reviewed in the broader context of other AI Frameworks, such as PyTorch, Theano, and Keras. We hope that this white paper helps you to answer the question posed about the relevance and importance of AI Robotics in your career planning and education.</p>
